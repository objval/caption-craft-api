        - [x] Logic to use FFmpeg to burn subtitles into the video.
        - [x] Logic to upload the final video to Cloudinary.
        - [x] Logic to update the video status and `final_video_cloudinary_id` in the database.
- [x] **Backend (API): Transcripts Module:**
    - [x] Implement the `transcripts` module (`controller`, `service`).
    - [x] Implement the `PUT /v1/transcripts/:id` endpoint.
- [x] **Frontend (Web): Video Gallery:**

    - [x] Implement the video player (using Cloudinary's player or a standard HTML5 player).
    - [x] Display the transcript in an editable format (e.g., a series of text inputs).
    - [x] Implement auto-saving of transcript edits to `PUT /v1/transcripts/:id`.
- [x] **Frontend (Web): Final Video & Download:**
    - [x] On the editor page, show the "Burn In" button.
    - [x] When status is `complete`, show a "Download" button linking to the final video URL.

### ‚ú® P2: Polish & User Experience

*These tasks will make the application feel professional and complete.*

- [ ] **UI/UX:** Implement a polished design system with consistent branding.
- [ ] **Frontend (Web):** Add a notification system (`react-hot-toast`) for user feedback.
- [ ] **Frontend (Web):** Add loading skeletons and spinners for a better perceived performance.
- [ ] **Editor:** Synchronize video playback with the transcript, highlighting the currently spoken word.
- [ ] **Emails:** Set up transactional emails (e.g., via Supabase) for welcome messages or important notifications.
- [ ] **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling on both the frontend and backend to gracefully manage failures (e.g., OpenAI API is down, video format is invalid).

### üöÄ P3: Post-Launch & Future Features

*Ideas for future expansion.*

- [ ] **Payments:** Implement a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe) to allow users to purchase credit packs.
- [ ] **Teams/Organizations:** Allow users to create teams and share video projects.
- [ ] **Customization:** Allow users to customize the appearance of the burned-in subtitles (font, color, size, position).
- [ ] **API for Developers:** Create a public API for other developers to use the transcription and burn-in service.
- [ ] **Admin Dashboard:** Create a dashboard for administrators to monitor system health, manage users, and view analytics.
